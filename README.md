# Python 3 Course

This repository contains class notes and solved exercises to reinforce the knowledge acquired in the Python 3 course. With more than **120 hours of content** and more than **620 classes**, the course covers everything from basic concepts to advanced topics, in addition to including bonus sections on key areas for web development and automation.

## What I learned:
- **Basic Python 3**: Fundamentals of programming logic and introduction to the language.
- **Intermediate Python 3**: Procedural and functional programming.
- **Advanced Python 3**: Object-oriented programming (OOP).
- **Python 3 Modules**: Using libraries such as PySide6 (Graphical Interface with Qt 6), Selenium, Django, among others.
- **Django**: Creating websites and APIs for web development.
- **Relational Databases**: Integration with SQLite3, MySQL and MariaDB.
- **Automated Tests**: Principles of TDD (Test-Driven Development) applied to projects.
- **Design Patterns**: Application of the main Design Patterns of the Gang of Four (GoF).

## Bonus Sections:
- **Regular Expressions**: Advanced string manipulation.
- **HTML5 and CSS3**: Fundamentals for creating web pages.
- **SQL with MySQL**: Queries and management of relational databases.
- **Unix Commands**: Operation in Linux, Mac and Windows terminals (via WSL2).

This course is ideal for those who want to master Python 3 and its main tools, from basic programming to the development of robust applications, following best practices.

I would like to give a special thanks to professor **Luiz Ot√°vio Miranda**, whose teaching skills and knowledge on the subject made this learning process enriching and rewarding.
